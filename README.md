# Glass-Classification
ðŸ”¹ Project Summary
Goal: Predict the type of glass (e.g., building windows, tableware, containers) based on its chemical composition.
Approach: Implemented Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classifiers using scikit-learn.
Business Value: Can be applied in forensic investigations (matching glass from crime scenes) or industrial quality control.

ðŸ”¹ Dataset Info
Dataset: UCI Glass Identification Dataset (glass.csv)
Records: 214 samples
Features: 9 chemical attributes:
RI (Refractive Index), Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ba, Fe
Target (output): Glass type (7 classes)

ðŸ”¹ Methodology

-Data Preprocessing
Loaded dataset using Pandas.
Separated features (X) and target (y).
Train-test split (80:20).
-Models Implemented
Decision Tree Classifier (criterion = gini, entropy tested).
KNN Classifier (tuned optimal K via error rate analysis).
-Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
Confusion matrix for misclassification patterns.

ðŸ”¹ Results

Decision Tree Classifier:
Accuracy â‰ˆ 72â€“75%
Key features: RI, Mg, Al, Ca contributed most.
KNN Classifier:
Accuracy â‰ˆ 70â€“73% with optimal K = 5
Error rate decreases initially as K increases, stabilizes after ~5.
